        I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
어두워진, hah, 앞길속에 (Ah)
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
I was the queen that I'm meant to be
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid, 끝없이 on stage
I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe
We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be
Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see
No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe
We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be
You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin'
밝게 빛나는 우린
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

        Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey
Don't want you, need you
Yeah, I need you to fill me up
마시고 마셔 봐도
성에 차지 않아
Got a feeling that, oh, yeah (Yeah)
You could be everything that
That I need (Need), taste so sweet (Sweet)
Every sip makes me want more, yeah
Lookin like snacks 'cause you got it like that (Woo)
Take a big bite, want another bite, yeah
너의 모든 걸 난 원해, 원해, 원해
너 말곤 모두 뻔해, 뻔해, 뻔해
When you're in my arms, I hold you so tight (So tight)
Can't let go, no, no, not tonight
지금 당장 날 봐 시간 없잖아
넌 내꺼야 이미 알고 있잖아
'Cause I need you to need me
I'm empty, you feed me so refreshing
My little soda pop
You're all I can think of
Every drop I drink up
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop
Cool me down, you're so hot
Pour me up, I won't stop
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop
My little soda pop
Uh, make me wanna flip the top
한 모금에 you hit the spot
Every little drip and drop, fizz and pop, ah
소름 돋아 it's gettin' hot
Yes, I'm sippin' when it's drippin' now
It's done? I need a second round
And pour a lot and don't you stop
'Til my soda pop fizzles out
꿈 속에 그려왔던 너
난 절대 놓칠 수 없어
널 원해 꼭
I waited so long for a taste of soda
So, the wait is over, baby
Come and fill me up
Just can't get enough
Oh
You're all I can think of
Every drop I drink up
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop (Yeah, yeah)
Cool me down, you're so hot
Pour me up, I won't stop (Oh, oh)
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You're my soda pop
Gotta drink every drop
